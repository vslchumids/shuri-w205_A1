Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

Conclusion / Support: For this question, I calculated the Pearson Correlation Value between the overall quality score and the HCAHPS patient 
survey score across all hospitals in the data set.  The result was -0.42845324071687263, which is not a strong correlation.  Also, the negative 
sign seems to imply that the measures for hospital quality and the measures used in the survey seems to have a reverse relationship, meaning that 
what's important from the hospitals' or regulation point of view does not necessarily agree with what's important for the patients

Justification for Approach: The hospitals_and_patients.sql script first builds a temporary table with the overall quality score by hospital using 
the same query as the best_hospitals script (without limiting to first 10 rows).  Then, a select query was written to join the hospital quality 
scores with the patient survey scores using the provider_id of the hospitals.  The corr() function was called on the resulting set of joined data.  

For the HCAHPS patient survey score, the base_score and consistency_score from the survey_response table was added together.  According to the 
HCAHPS fact sheet (http://www.hcahpsonline.org/files/August%202013%20HCAHPS%20Fact%20Sheet2.pdf), the base_score and consistency_score are the 
2 main parts of the Patient Experience of Care Domain score.  Each of the eight HCAHPS dimensions measured in the survey are already encapsulated 
in the HCAHPS base score and consistency score.
